# Working memory distraction V3
Collection of first year project experiments. 
* V9-11 were the ones that ultimately ended up in the research paper and presentation.
* Interested in testing RNN predictions of false memories (Bouchacourt and Buschman 2019 model). 
* Created working memory experiments with pure noise distractors.
